**Developing agentic software?**

I am posting content here that will help you get idea on building agentic software systems.

Before you proceed, you need to remember...

**Machines don't learn or think like humans do! It's all math.**

<a href="/2025/04/24/smart-machines/">Know more...</a>

In my opinion, crafting agentic software depends mainly on five maturity areas...

1️⃣ Complexity of the problem and how agents can help (will it really benefit with such a solution?)

2️⃣ The level of accuracy and human intervention required (beware, LLMs are probabilistic software!)

3️⃣ Agent personas with clear objectives: <a href="/2025/03/16/llm-bayes-theorem/">Write clever prompts</a> using different prompt engineering techniques

4️⃣ Thinking simple workflows: Restrospecting the output at every step, understand what can improve accuracy

5️⃣ Implications on security, privacy and compliance

**To build capabilities in agentic AI, you could use this three step process.**

I followed this three step process myself.

**✨ Step 1: Be an efficient software craftsman**

✅ <a href="/2025/10/04/gen-ai-benefits/">Stop thinking that AI is the answer to all your problems</a>

✅ Be part of, or develop an excellent engineering culture

✅ Collaborate, experiment and learn; understand what others are doing

✅ Learn Python, async programming, API development and one database

<a href="#">Why Python?</a>

✅ Read why LLMs are called probabilistic systems, use ChatGPT or Gemini and experiment with prompts

**✨ Step 2: Understand the building blocks**

✅ Start small; build a simple chatbot and experiment with different prompt techniques

✅ Learn vector databases, tokens, text embedding, chunks, etc

✅ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN_2fnOPY-M">Build a RAG workflow</a>, connect it with the chatbot, add memory - Try <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-rag">Agentic RAG</a>!

✅ Learn different RAG techniques and simple tool usage with LLMs

✅ Understand the economics of cloud computing


**✨ Step 3: Develop agents**

✅ Build a system with two agents that interact with each other, define agent goals

✅ Optimize tokens by engineering agent context!

✅ Learn structured inputs, structured outputs and guardrails

✅ Learn agentic workflow patterns and orchestration, add multiple agents

✅ Provide tools to the agents, learn Model Context Protocol

✅ Logging, monitoring, LLMOps and deployment

✅ Dive deep into evals
