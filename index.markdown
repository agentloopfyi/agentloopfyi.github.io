Hi there! My name is Saurav Dey. 

I am an AI Engineer by profession. I build (and consult on) agentic AI software systems. [Contact](/contact)

This is my personal website and blog.

Here I write my opinionated views on things I am interested in â€” Could be anything, things I do, learn and experience in life and work.

I research, observe, implement (ROI).. love to collect knowledge from just about any source, deep dive more, and build something out of it.
- Research: Know, read, link, create a mind-map
- Observe: Learn what others are doing, their success and failures
- Implement: Take the simplest idea, build, collect feedback
- Repeat ðŸ”„

âœ¨ [Learn AI](/learn-ai) â€” Collecting some awesome content on AI.
