Think faster and take decisions without additional stress.

1. If it's not a **STRONG YES**, it's a no.
2. Figure out what can cause a failure and avoid that.
3. When lost, go back to the starting point. Break it down to basic, build on facts. 
4. The simplest explanation is usually the right one.
5. Never assume a bad decision was taken by someone with bad intent, it could have simply been a mistake.
6. What's urgent, isn't usually important; and what's important isn't usually urgent.
7. Don't revert a decision without knowing why it was taken.
